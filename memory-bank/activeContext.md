   - shadcn/ui components integrated

2. ✅ Infrastructure setup complete
   - Node.js v24.11.0 LTS installed
   - npm v11.6.1 installed
   - All 566 dependencies installed
   - DynamoDB table: mathsage-sessions (ACTIVE)
   - S3 bucket: mathsage-images-971422717446
   - Environment variables system with validation

3. ✅ Project structure and documentation
   - Memory bank system implemented
   - Documentation organized in docs/
   - Project plan updated with improvements analysis

## Next Immediate Steps

1. ✅ Logo file added (public/logo.svg)
2. Test UI locally (npm run dev) - Verify logo displays correctly
3. Begin Phase 2: LLM Integration
   - OpenAI API integration
   - Socratic prompt engineering
   - Response validation
4. Implement API routes (chat, parse-image)

## Current Status

**Completed:**
- ✅ Professional UI with full navigation
- ✅ Brand identity integrated
- ✅ All UI components built
- ✅ Responsive design
- ✅ AWS infrastructure ready

**In Progress:**
- ⏳ UI testing and refinement (verify logo displays correctly)

**Next:**
- Begin Phase 1: Enhanced Feedback System
- Implement step analysis engine
- Build feedback generation system
- Create error classification system

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Sequential, thorough implementation
- Complete each phase before moving to next
- Address all learning science problems before launch
- **Final Plan**: docs/FINAL_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md (comprehensive, integrated)
- **Reference Docs**: 
  - docs/PROJECT_PLAN.md (original plan + learning science phases)
  - docs/LEARNING_SCIENCE_IMPLEMENTATION.md (detailed learning science)
  - docs/PLAN_IMPROVEMENTS_ANALYSIS.md (improvements analysis)
